# Joshua Arulsamy - @jarulsamy

Hi there! I'm Josh, an energetic computer science student at the University of
Wyoming, seeking a career that fits my professional skills, and personality.
I love tinkering and learning anything related to computing. I am currently
conducting undergraduate research under the [MALLET AI](http://mallet.ai)
group, so I'm not as active here.
