# Joshua Arulsamy - @jarulsamy

Hi there, I'm Josh. I'm a system administrator at the University of Wyoming for
the Advanced Research Computing Center (ARCC). I primarily work on Linux
management related projects nowadays, but you can still find many general
projects I've worked on over the years here.
